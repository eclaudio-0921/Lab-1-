  <p>&amp; Good evening. Eric Claudio Signing in on the first week of web design</p>
  <p>&amp; As a Senior student looking forward to get into coding, I expect to take my advances in this class and really show how much I can from my instructors. I can't wait to incorporate my knowledge in creating my own websites and digital packets to show my interest of arts just by clicking a link. </p>
